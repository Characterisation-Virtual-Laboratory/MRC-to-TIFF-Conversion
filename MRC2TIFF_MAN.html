MRC2TIFF (1)                General Commands Manual                 MRC2TIFF (1)


<b>NAME</b>
       MRC2TIFF.sh - Create TIFF files from a folder of MRC image files using
       iMOD's mrc2tif function.

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       MRC2TIFF.sh [-p &lt;num&gt;] src [dest]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       iMOD's mrc2tif function creates a TIFF file from a single MRC file.
       MRC2TIFF.sh process a directory rather than a single file.  It accepts a
       dir as it's input, searches for all MRC files inside that dir, splits the
       list of found MRC files into a number of parts, and runs each part
       in parallel.  A dir structure matching the source dir structure is
       created with in the destination dir, and the resulting TIFFs are saved
       into this dir layout.  Running each part in parallel potentially speeds
       up the conversion process depending on avaibale CPU cores.  The '-p' flag
       can be set to '1' if a single conversion process is required.

       iMODs mrc2tif function is called with the '-s -c 5' flags.
       '-s' give a single TIFF file (stack) out per MRC file.
       '-c 5' specifies LZW (lossless) compression.

<b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-p</b> <i>number</i>
              Split the found MRC files into this number of parts to be run in
              parallel.  A default value can be set via the 'defaultPartCount'
              variable at the start of the script.

       <b>src</b>    Path to project dir of MRC files to be converted.

       <b>dest</b>   Path to output dir for tiff files.  Project dir + subfolder
              structure will be created underneath this dir.  A default location
              can be set via the 'defaultDestination' variable at the start of
              the script.
